# The Perfect Human is Swedish: A Rebuttal to Pachter's Puerto Rican Perfection

In a recent article, Lior Pachter claims that [the perfect human is Puerto Rican](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/the-perfect-human-is-puerto-rican/), citing a mix of genetics and culture that allegedly results in the "best" human specimens. While this might sound convincing at first glance, I believe it is my duty to present a counterargument rooted in equally rigorous satire and dubious interpretations of data.

First and foremost, let’s talk genetics. Pachter points to the diverse genetic makeup of Puerto Ricans as a strength. However, we Swedes have our own claim to genetic fame. The Swedish gene pool is the product of centuries of Viking resilience, birthing individuals with unparalleled physical prowess and mental fortitude. The Swedes' ability to withstand freezing temperatures and maintain a high quality of life in a landscape that resembles a winter wonderland most of the year is a testament to our superior adaptation skills.

### Physical Attributes: The Nordic Edge

When discussing physical attributes, one cannot overlook the iconic Swedish features: tall stature, robust health, and striking blonde hair. This isn't just a Hollywood stereotype; it’s backed by anecdotal evidence found in countless Scandinavian crime dramas and IKEA commercials. Swedes are designed by nature to be the epitome of health and attractiveness. The long, harsh winters have forged a population that is not only physically resilient but also mentally sharp—necessary for surviving months of darkness without succumbing to cabin fever.

### Cultural Contributions: More Than Just ABBA and IKEA

Culturally, Sweden’s contributions to the world are nothing short of legendary. While Pachter celebrates the cultural vibrancy of Puerto Ricans, let's not forget that Sweden gave the world ABBA, the Nobel Prize, and meatballs that are a staple in kitchens worldwide. Our minimalist design philosophy has revolutionized modern living spaces, proving that Swedes have a natural knack for aesthetics and practicality. Additionally, Sweden’s progressive social policies and high standard of living are frequently cited as models for the rest of the world.

### Environmental Stewardship: The Eco-Friendly Ideal

In an era where climate change is the existential threat of our time, the perfect human must be environmentally conscious. Sweden’s commitment to sustainability and green living is unparalleled. Our cities are designed with extensive green spaces, cycling is a national pastime, and renewable energy sources power a significant portion of our infrastructure. The Swedish model of eco-friendly living demonstrates an ideal blend of modernity and respect for nature.

### Linguistic Supremacy: Mastery of Languages

Swedes are often multilingual, fluent in Swedish, English, and often other European languages. This linguistic dexterity is a clear indicator of superior cognitive abilities. In contrast, Pachter’s focus on Puerto Rican bilingualism, primarily in Spanish and English, while impressive, simply cannot compete with the typical Swede’s polyglot prowess. After all, the perfect human must be able to communicate with as many people as possible, fostering global unity and understanding.

### Conclusion: The Swedish Paragon

While Pachter’s article presents an interesting case for Puerto Rican perfection, it overlooks the compelling evidence supporting the superiority of Swedes. From genetic resilience and physical attributes to cultural contributions and environmental stewardship, the Swedes represent the true pinnacle of human evolution. As a satire writer and avid advocate for Swedish excellence, I invite you to reconsider the evidence and embrace the undeniable fact: the perfect human is, without a doubt, Swedish.
